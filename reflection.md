# Project Reflection

My program was a simple attempt to create a game like space invaders. The most challenging part was to create hit boxes and do collision detection. If i started now i would start with creating the aliens first and make the whole grid of aliens bounce on the edges instead of having only one collumn bounce. The aliens would come in different waves once all of the first ones were killed. I would include sound and fonts too. I am proud of how efficiently my classes work.
